CPR combines chest compressions with rescue breathing to maintain blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs until emergency medical services arrive. This technique can double or triple a person's chance of survival after cardiac arrest. CPR should be performed immediately when someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally - every minute without CPR decreases survival chances by 7-10%. The technique involves pushing hard and fast on the center of the chest to pump blood to the brain and other vital organs.",
